# Gost-DOM - Headless browser for Go

Your go-to solution for a TDD workflow

## About

This is the home of go-dom, a headless browser for Go build for testing web
applications with JavaScript. It is specifically written with Go/HTMX in mind, a
tech combination gaining in popularity.

This is created by me, Peter Str√∏iman, a software developer with 25+ years of
experience in software development, primarily web development.

The project itself has spawned a few related side projects, all collected here
under the gost-dom organisation.

## Repositories

- [browser](https://github.com/gost-dom/browser) The browser itself
- [code-gen](https://github.com/gost-dom/code-gen) Code generator for code-dom
- [generators](https://github.com/gost-dom/generators) Generic Go code generation layer
- [webref](https://github.com/gost-dom/webref) Exposes Go structs representin web standards specifications

## Looking for sponsors.

I am looking for sponsors, else I will have to abandon the project, to make time
for paying work.

Github sponsors is not enabled for this organisation (yet), but I have sponsors
enabled on my private profile.

This is a massive undertaking, and having people helping out would be amazing.
